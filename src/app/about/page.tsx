                At Samarasa, we believe that coffee is more than a beverage -
                it's a bridge to stories, a connection to our roots, and an
                expression of art. Our journey began with a deep love for local
                coffee beans and a mission to celebrate Indonesia's rich coffee
                heritage. Since our founding in 2016, we have partnered with
                farmers across the archipelago, ensuring each cup you enjoy
                supports sustainable practices and fair trade.

                From a humble beginning as a small caf√© in Depok, Samarasa has
                grown into a community hub cherished by coffee enthusiasts. Over
                the years, we've celebrated key milestones - such as launching
                our signature blend, collaborating with local artists, and
                expanding our reach while staying true to our artisanal roots.
